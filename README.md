# CSS Bits

Contains bits of CSS (plus Lesss/Sass) that I wish to preserve.

## Hexagons

Turns a list into responsive hexagons tiles and rows. See an example of how to use it in `hexagons/example.html`. 

Uses Bootstrap 3 (since it was developed in 2015). In due time, I might try and fix this code to simplify it and make it Bootstrap-less.
